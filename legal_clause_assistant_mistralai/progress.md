# ðŸ“Š Project Progress: Legal Clause Assistant (CUAD-based RAG)

## âœ… Project Initialization
- [x] Project scaffold generated and unzipped into working directory
- [x] Virtual environment created (`llmragenv`)
- [x] `requirements.txt` installed with necessary libraries
- [x] FastAPI backend scaffold in place (`main.py`)
- [x] Gradio UI scaffold in place (`gradio_ui.py`)
- [x] Dockerfile and README placeholder created

## ðŸš§ Placeholder Components (to be implemented or expanded)
- [ ] `ingest.py` â€“ placeholder: to load, chunk, and embed CUAD contract data
- [ ] `retriever.py` â€“ placeholder: to implement retrieval with metadata filters
- [ ] `qa_chain.py` â€“ placeholder: to connect retriever + LLM with prompt template
- [ ] `eval.py` â€“ placeholder: to evaluate the system using `ragas` or CUAD-based clause metrics

## ðŸ§  Prompt Engineering
- [x] `prompts.py` added with base legal prompt template (placeholder for refinement)

## ðŸ§ª Testing
- [x] FastAPI `/ask` endpoint tested with dummy return
- [x] Gradio UI wired to backend and successfully tested (with placeholder response)

## ðŸ”œ Next Milestones
- [ ] Parse and ingest CUAD dataset
- [ ] Build vector DB from contracts using BGE embeddings
- [ ] Connect retrieval + LLM chain for real contract clause answers
- [ ] Add clause-level metadata and filters
- [ ] Evaluate grounding with clause match and `ragas`
